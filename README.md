# Caster
Smartwatch-esqe remote controller and communicator

This device is made to be in many ways, an arduino-based custom wrist mounted version of the Flipper-Zero with built-in LoRa. Additionally there will be a default loRa messaging app, based on Bobricus's [Armachat](https://github.com/bobricius/armachat). 

This project is still deep in alpha, and is subject to change rapidly
